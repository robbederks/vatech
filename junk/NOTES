- found cheap on ebay, thanks @christian!
- nicely built case, expensive connectors
- main components on pcb:
  - ARM SOC, flash, RAM
  - ADCs, FPGA
  - power supplies, figuring out the rail voltages
  - ethernet
- dumping the flash:
  - T48? no adapter!
  - openocd support for chip: jtag?
  - pinout: google!
  - repo with dump scripts
- exploring the image:
  - strings: linux!
  - binwalk to figure out the general structure
  - JFFS2 image! extract with dd and mount to extract rootfs
- connecting:
  - eth0 config in /etc
  - nmap of interface to get open ports
  - telnetd -> we need a password
  - /etc/passwd has the hash
  - jack the ripper to brute force it (fast!)
- exploring the other running services:
  - ps -A
  - port 20000: equus!
- ghidra:
  - still has debug symbols
  - dbg_printf is empty
  - patch to branch to printf
  - two sockets! 20000 and 20001
  - ftp to get the file back on the board
- write python app
  - somehow only works for one connection when only using control socket
  - need to also send something to the other socket
  - implementing the commands
